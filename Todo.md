```
Writing an event in LPC is nothing more that providing step by step
instructions for what happens when a given event occurs.  The LPC term
for an event is a function (sometimes you will hear people refer to
functions as methods).  The Nightmare Object Library uses four types of
events:

#1 MudOS initiated events, sometimes called an "apply"
The names of these events are all lower case.  The most common apply
is the create() event.  It is caused by the creation of the object.

#2 Attribute manipulation events
These are the SetXXX() and GetXXX() events.  They exist basically to
allow other objects to find out about an object's attributes, or to do
initial setup for an object's attributes.

#3 Modal events
These are the CanXXX() events.  They get called often just prior to a
behaviour type of an event.  For example, I am trying to leave a room,
so my leave behaviour asks the room if I can leave.  This would be
CanLeave() in the room.  If CanLeave() says I can leave, then the
leave event is triggered in the room.

#4 True events
A true event is identified by eventXXX().  These type of events are
the meat of what is happening in the game.  Any given true event is
generally in turn triggered by some other true event.  The chain
generally can be traced as starting with a player or NPC command at
some point.
